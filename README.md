# KN classify

## Kilonova-Targeting Lightcurve Classifier (KaLC)

- The framework of classifier is based on Temporal Convolutional Neural (TCN) network, which was implemented by [RAPID](https://github.com/daniel-muthukrishna/astrorapid/tree/master). You can find fast tutorial there. 

- A modified framework is employed, referring to [Chatterjee et al. ](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stab3023)

- The package is unable to install through ```pip``` currently. 

### Installization

- Through Github repository

```
git clone https://github.com/LAujust/KN_classify.git
```
